[OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/) can automatically manage dependencies, it is recommended to use it to install the framework.

Requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)'s npm and openupm-cli, if not installed please install them first.

    # Install openupm-cli,please ignore if it is already installed.
    npm install -g openupm-cli 
    
    #Go to the root directory of your project
    cd F:/workspace/New Unity Project
    
    #Install loxodon-framework
    openupm add com.vovgou.loxodon-framework
    
### Install via Packages/manifest.json (recommended)

Modify the Packages/manifest.json file in your project, add the third-party repository "package.openupm.com"'s configuration and add "com.vovgou.loxodon-framework" in the "dependencies" node.

The framework and all plugins have also been published to the npm repository.
